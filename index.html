                    <h2>About Me:</h2>
                        <p>Hello! My name is Edgardo and I am self taught programmer. 
                        My journey began in March of 2022 after meeting up with a good friend 
                        from college who inspired me to make a career change. 
                        But before I get to that, first let me tell you a bit about who I am. 
                        I was born and raised in Los Angeles. I am the youngest sibling of four.
                        I am a first generation Mexican-American and I enjoy sports, 
                        movies, and spending time with my family. After high school 
                        I attened Brown University where I studied economics. Upon graduation
                        I returned home to Los Angeles where I worked in food and 
                        beverage at a company called Levy Restaurants as an Accounts Payable Clerk. 
                        After 2 years at Levy, I went on to work at a Property Management company where 
                        I was a supervisor for the maintenance department. 
                        <br>
                        After 4 long years, I finally decided that I needed to make a change:
                        I was going to teach myself to program! Shout out to my boy Mario Vega for putting
                        me up on game when it comes to programming and making me realize that I can too
                        can learn to code if I put in the time and effort. With a mentor in my corner
                        and my determination to get away from a paycheck to paycheck lifestyle, 
                        I decided to bet on myself and embark on my long journey of becoming a programmer.
                        <br>
                        Now I have to admit, it has been harder and taken longer than I expected but I'm still at it.
                        It's comforting to know that learning to code is very similar to working out:
                        It's a life long journer, it's truly never ending. There is always something new
                        to learn. Knowing that, helps me in times of frustration when I feel like I'm
                        learning to slow or don't understand a topic. But so far, I've gotten approximately
                        30% of the way through the Full Stack Course on Codecademy and my current project is
                        to build my personal website. So here it is! What do you think??
                        <br>
                        Feel free to leave me a comment on how I can improve this site!
                        <br>           
                        I hope to continue learning front-end developement skills and hope to persue an entry
                        level job in wed design within in the next 6-8 months.</p>
